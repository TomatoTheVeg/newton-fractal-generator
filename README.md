# Newton Fractal Visualization (ISPC + C++)
Jetbrains internship test project.

This project visualizes the **Newton Fractal** for the equation:

f(z) = z^n - 1 = 0

using **ISPC** (Intel SPMD Program Compiler) for parallel computation and **C++** for orchestration, image output, and benchmarking.

The resulting image shows which **root** each initial complex value converges to (color), and how **quickly** it converges (brightness).
